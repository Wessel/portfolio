    <p>I'm a developer and student of Technical Computer Science at InHolland Alkmaar.</p>
    <p>I'm proficient at speaking English and Dutch.</p>
    <p>I have used a lot of programming languages and Databases, some of them are
      <span class="underline-slider html">HTML</span>,
      <span class="underline-slider njs">NodeJS</span>,
      <span class="underline-slider py">Python</span> and
      <span class="underline-slider other">more</span>.
    </p>
    <div class="html more">
      <p>HTML is the first language that I learned. I was always curious about how things worked, and first started
        messing around in inspect element. After a bit I made my first site, which was very ugly but worked. Nowadays
        I've gotten a lot better with HTML and can make good-functioning sites.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="njs more">
      <p>My first ever NJS project was a Discord bot that I created 6 months after I made my account.
        At this point there were no real bot accounts on Discord, so I used an alt which has since been lost.
        I've since made many diffrent projects using Node</p>
    </div>
    <div class="py more">
      <p>I started learning python after I got a bit of basic knowledge of NJS.
        I started with a basic snake game with pygame and eventually started messing around with neural networks.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="other more">
      <p>I know a lot more than just HTML, Python and NodeJS, I also know how to use rust & elixir relatively well.
        I'm proficient in using SASS, CSS and JS. I have a dualboot of Windows 10, Arch linux & ParrotOS (based on
        debian).
        For servers I tend to use RedHat or Arch. I also know a lot about MongoDB and Redis..
